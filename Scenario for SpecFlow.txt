In order to share my car

As a car owner

I want to publish it on intranet with details like source, destination, time, email, phone no

Scenario: Employee enter valid ride details to share

Given Employee “Naveen” wanted to submit source, destination and time as “Mumbai”, “Pune” and “5.30pm” 

And “Naveen” email is “naveenhome@gmail.com” and phone no is “+91 98105987500”

When “Naveen” click on “Share”

Then Ride get added and “Naveen” get a message “Ride is shared.” with “OK” button

And “Naveen” get redirected to home page on clicking on “OK” button

And “Naveen” can see his ride on top on “Home” page
